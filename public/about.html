          Our aim is to explore learning from the student's perspective, where the main source of guidance for a student
          is other students. Each student can be a source of knowledge for others. Hence, for a student, developing their
          unique point of view on a subject is one of the primary goals. Students are encouraged to develop and share
          their learning experiences with others.
